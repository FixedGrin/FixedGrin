### 🧭 About Me

I'm pivoting into cybersecurity after working in customer-focused roles.  
I thrive under pressure, enjoy solving problems, and have a growing toolkit of hands-on experience using tools like **Splunk**, **Wireshark**, and **Python** to detect and analyze threats.

I’m particularly passionate about:
- 🔐 **Blue Team operations** and SOC workflows  
- 🧠 Developing tools that make threat detection smarter and faster  
- 📈 Continual learning and practical experimentation

### 🎯 Current Focus

- Building a cybersecurity portfolio through real-world projects  
- Gaining deeper experience with endpoint visibility tools like Sysmon  
- Exploring detection engineering and automation (e.g., SOAR)
